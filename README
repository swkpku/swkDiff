# Algorithm 

str1: abcbdab 
str2: bdcaba

str2 is a modification of str1.

edit graph:

   a  b  c  b  d  a  b
b  ↓  ↘  →  ↘  →  →  ↘ 

d  ↓  ↓  ↓  ↓  ↘  →  → 

c  ↓  ↓  ↘  →  ↓  ↓  ↓ 

a  ↘  ↓  ↓  ↓  ↓  ↘  → 

b  ↓  ↘  ↓  ↘  →  ↓  ↘ 

a  ↘  ↓  ↓  ↓  ↓  ↘  ↓ 

start from the right-bottom corner of the edit graph to track the optimal path:
1. encounter a "↓" means that there is a insert operation.
2. encounter a "→" means that there is a delete operation.
3. encounter a "↘ " means that there is a match between str1 and str2.
